Some weights of XLNetForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at xlnet-base-cased and are newly initialized: ['logits_proj.bias', 'sequence_summary.summary.weight', 'logits_proj.weight', 'sequence_summary.summary.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Detected kernel version 4.18.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
